## Introduction

The Python Benchmarking Tool is a Python-based tool designed to benchmark data processing applications and measure their performance across different concurrency models. The tool supports threading, multiprocessing, asyncio, and gevent concurrency models. Results are displayed using both Matplotlib and text-based format visualization.

## Features

- Benchmarking of data processing applications
- Measurement of CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network I/O, and response time
- Support for threading, multiprocessing, asyncio, and gevent concurrency models
- Results displayed using both Matplotlib and text-based format visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use the Python Benchmarking Tool, follow these steps:

1. Define the scenario to benchmark
2. Choose the concurrency model to test
3. Run the benchmarking tool and analyze the results


Supported concurrency models are `threading`, `multiprocessing`, `asyncio`, and `gevent`.
