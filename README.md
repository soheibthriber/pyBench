Python Benchmarking Tool
A Python-based benchmarking tool that measures the performance of data processing applications using different concurrency models. The tool measures CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network I/O, and response time for various scenarios, such as sorting a large list, processing a large dataset, and running a machine learning algorithm. The tool provides both text-based and graphical visualizations of the benchmark results, using Matplotlib.

Features
Measures CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network I/O, and response time
Supports threading, multiprocessing, asyncio, and gevent concurrency models
Measures performance for various scenarios, such as sorting a large list, processing a large dataset, and running a machine learning algorithm
Provides both text-based and graphical visualizations of the benchmark results
Uses Matplotlib for generating graphs and plots
Open source and contributions are welcome
Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/python-benchmark-tool.git
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the benchmarking tool: python benchmark.py
Usage
The benchmarking tool accepts command-line arguments for specifying the concurrency model and the scenario to be benchmarked. For example:


python benchmark.py --model threading --scenario sort_list --size 100000
The tool supports the following concurrency models:

threading: Uses Python's built-in threading module
multiprocessing: Uses Python's built-in multiprocessing module
asyncio: Uses Python's asyncio library
gevent: Uses the Gevent library for greenlet-based concurrency
The tool supports the following scenarios:

sort_list: Sorts a large list of numbers
process_dataset: Processes a large dataset of text files
run_ml: Runs a machine learning algorithm on a large dataset
The --size argument specifies the size of the dataset to be processed. For example, --size 100000 will process a dataset with 100000 items.

Results
The benchmarking tool generates both text-based and graphical visualizations of the benchmark results. The text-based output shows the CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network I/O, and response time for the benchmarked scenario. The graphical output shows the CPU and memory usage over time, as well as the response time for each request.
